# PropertyScraper
Zoopla Scraper implemented using JSoup. 

Any location can be added to the scraper in the String array listed in the main function.

An initial visit to the zoopla website will be needed to check the url and whether or not a location will need to include its county too.

Scraped data will be saved into a csv file via the relative path of the program.
